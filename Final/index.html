  <img class="pics" src="assets/shelter.png" alt="in progress picture of dog shelter">
  Established in 2022, by Erik Villanueva and Sydney Hill who are proud supporters and advocates of animals with disabilities. This start up was originally
  created for a Web Development Technologies class but grew into much more work than we ever imagined. Now with the help of the website we developed there is a place to
  donate to the poor college students who just want to help the tri-pups.

To achieve our goal of building the world's largest shelter for our three leg friends we need to raise 1.5 billion dollars. This may seem extreme but because the cost of labor and lumber has gone up so much during the pandemic,
our goal has only become more unattainable, that's why we need your help. Please consider donating so we can build our shelter and help these tri-pups.
